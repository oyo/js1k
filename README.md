# JS1k 2010 Contributions

[JS1k](https://js1k.com/) was a code golfing competition where you could
submit any demo with no more than 1024 bytes JavaScript code. I wrote a
[barcode renderer](https://js1k.com/2010-first/details/563)
and an interactive 2D
[physics simulation](https://js1k.com/2010-first/details/564)
for the very first edition of this challange.

See the demos here: https://oyo.github.io/js1k/
